                  <h5>1) Purchase Terms &amp; Conditions</h5>
                  <p>Financial Transactions:</p>
                  <p>For payment we refer you to a reputable and Secure 3rd party payment processor that we have no association with. Any dispute arising out of said transaction must be conducted between you and the payment processor. However we will endeavor to assist you as necessary when appropriate.</p>
                  <p>Returns for exchange:</p>
                  <p>We like happy customers telling the world what great pickups we make and are prepared to exchange if the results are not as dramatic as our customer hoped for. Returns for exchange within 14 days of receiving your order escape the 10% restocking fee (see below) but you will have to pay the shipping cost of the replacements as well as the cost of returning.</p>
                  <p>Returns for refund:</p>
                  <p>We accept only items purchased direct from Kinman for return or refund. Returns for refund are subject to a restocking fee of 10% of purchase price (not including shipping) plus deduction of original freight/insurance costs plus any damage (wear and tear). Returns are allowed within fourteen (14) days of your receipt of the consignment provided the products are ‘As New’ (cable solder points excepted). Cost of restoring to ‘As New’ condition will be deducted from your refund. You will need to contact us for a Return Authorization and instructions before returning the goods. Do not return without hearing from us first and be mindful that emails sometimes go missing. Before requesting return authorization think about selling the pickups (eBay etc). Kinman’s command high resale value so it’s likely you will save the restocking fee and return shipping costs.</p>
                  <p>Defective items:</p>
                  <p>If a product is not working on arrival or stops working after a time you agree to us sending remedial instructions and you agree to try the remedy. If the remedy is carried out properly but it fails we will send a fresh replacement product at no cost to you upon receiving and confirming the failed unit at our factory. You must notify us on our Message Board of any failure as soon as possible. This applies to any new product for a period of 30 days from date of delivery.</p>  
                  <p>Order cancellations:</p>
                  <p>If a customer cancels their order a cancellation fee of Administration cost of $30 USD or 10% of order amount whichever is the higher will apply. This covers the time consuming expenses incurred in processing, back tracking, communicating and refunding. An exception is where Kinman is unable to deliver in a reasonable time. We consider 35 days is a reasonable time and is still more prompt than most in the music industry.</p>
                  <p>If the order has already shipped the original cost of shipping and return shipping costs will be deducted from the refund as well as any other deductions that are applicable. See Return for refund above.</p>
                  <p>Specially made items:</p>
                  <p>for example reverse magnetic polarity, reverse wind coils, Gold plating or anything else that is not a standard stock item will not be accepted for refund or exchange. We might, at our option, consider return for exchange provided compensation cost is applied to restore the item to stock standard specifications if that is possible.</p>
                  <p>Warranty:</p>
                  <p>All products except pots in harness are warranted to be free from manufacturing and material defects for 12 months. Pots are warranted for 3 months. This warranty specifically excludes damage caused by incorrect handling or neglect. Warranty is to the original owner and is not transferable.</p>
